# Abstract

The RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) has been designed to be highly modular. This makes it an ideal platform for processor formal verification, which is a critical step in the design of processor cores. This report presents the formal verification of the PAF core, an open-source rv32i core written by university students, the implementation and verification of the Bit Manipulation RISC-V extension on this core, and the contribution to the `riscv-formal` tool to support this extension. Moreover, the report includes the formal verification of an AXI-lite random memory controller, which I used to formally verify AXI-lite variant of the picorv32 core. We conclude with an analysis of the contributions of the research, including a timing and area analysis of the modified core. The results of this work provide a strong foundation for further improvements to the PAF Core.
